The song was released as the third and final single from ''California'' on April 18, 2017, and the band's last to be released through [[BMG Rights Management|BMG]]. It is a [[ballad]] with a [[Fingerstyle guitar|finger-picked guitar]] and strings. Lyrically, the song revolves around the idea of letting go of loved ones. Bassist [[Mark Hoppus]] and producer [[John Feldmann]] first began developing the song while discussing their families, and how tough it might be when their children grow up and leave home. The song was written by Hoppus, Feldmann, drummer [[Travis Barker]], guitarist [[Matt Skiba]], and songwriter [[David Hodges]].\n\nThe song has peaked at number 32 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'s}} [[Alternative Songs]] chart. Its [[music video]] shows the band members relaxing with family and friends before heading out on tour.\n\nDespite the fact that it was released as a single, the song was not performed live by the band on [[California Tour|''California'''s supporting tour]]. However, the band eventually played it on their Kings of the Weekend residency shows in Las Vegas.\n\n==Background==\nProducer John Feldmann recalled that they \"needed\" a ballad\u2014\"whatever that means for Blink\"\u2014for ''California''. The concept behind the song, according to bassist Mark Hoppus, is \"letting go of people hugely important in your life.\"<ref name=\"kerrang\">{{cite news|date=June 4, 2016|title=Behind Enema Lines|pages=16\u201321|author=James Hickie|work=[[Kerrang!]]|issue=1622}}</ref> He and Feldmann met for coffee one morning before getting into the studio, and the subject of their children came up.

[[Stock repurchase]]s also increase [[shareholder value]] provided that the shares purchased are cancelled or held in treasury but not used as a device to make up for dilution from option issuances to management and others. [[Debt reduction|Reducing debt]] can also produce a de facto dividend; assuming the value of the firm remains the same, shareholder value is increased as debt is reduced.\n\nTo understand how debt reduction increases [[shareholder value]], it is helpful to consider the 1958 paper by Nobel laureates [[Franco Modigliani]] and [[Merton H. Miller]] entitled ''The Cost of Capital, Corporation Finance and the Theory of Investment''.<ref>Franco Modigliani and Merton H. Miller (June 1958), \u201cThe Cost of Capital, Corporation Finance and the Theory of Investment,\u201d The American Economic Review, Vol. 48, No. 3.</ref> This paper proved that a firm\u2019s value is independent of how it is financed, provided that one ignores the tax effect of debt interest. If [[Franco Modigliani|Modigliani]] and [[Merton H. Miller|Miller]] are correct, the use of [[free cash flow]] to repay debt results in a transfer of wealth from the debtor to the shareholder.\n\n==History of term==\nThe term shareholder yield was coined by William W. Priest of Epoch Investment Partners in a paper in 2005 entitled ''The Case for Shareholder Yield as a Dominant Driver of Future Equity Returns'' as a way to look more holistically at how companies allocate and distribute cash rather than considering dividends in isolation.<ref>William W. Priest (December 2005), ''The Case for Shareholder Yield as a Dominant Driver of Future Equity Returns'', Epoch Investment Partners.</ref> This concept was further detailed in the 2007 book, ''Free Cash Flow and Shareholder Yield: New Priorities for the Global Investor'', by William W. Priest and Lindsay H. McClelland.<ref>William W. Priest and Lindsay H. McClelland (2007) ''Free Cash Flow and Shareholder Yield: New Priorities for the Global Investor'', Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons. {{ISBN|978-0-470-12833-6}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Stock market]]\n[[Category:Shareholders|Yield]]"}]},"2717941":{"pageid":2717941,"ns":0,"title":"Justus Miles Forman","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{short description|American dramatist}}\n\n{{Use mdy dates|date=December 2020}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name         = Justus Miles Forman  \n| image        = Justus Miles Forman.jpg\n| caption      = Justus Miles Forman\n| birth_name   = \n| birth_date   = {{Birth date|1875|11|1}}\n| birth_place  = Le Roy, New York\n| death_date   = {{Death date and age|1915|5|7|1875|11|1}}\n| death_place  = {{RMS|Lusitania}}, [[Atlantic Ocean]]\n| other_names  = \n| occupation   = \n| years_active = \n| spouse       = \n| children     = \n| signature    = Signature of Justus Miles Forman.png\n}}\n\n'''Justus Miles Forman''' (November 1, 1875 &ndash; May 7, 1915) was an American novelist and playwright.\n\n==Biography==\nForman was born on November 1, 1875 in [[Le Roy, New York]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=1949 |title=Forman, Justus Miles |encyclopedia=The New Funk & Wagnalls Encyclopedia |volume=14 |page=5112|publisher=Unicorn Publishers, Inc. |location=New York}}</ref> He attended [[Yale University]].\n\nHis only play, ''The Hyphen'', appeared in 1915 but did not receive the success Forman expected. ''The Hyphen'' was a topical drama about \"German-Americans\" and \"Irish-Americans\" whose patriotism and fidelity to the United States is questioned due to events in Europe during [[World War I]].

He traveled extensively in [[Restoration (Spain)|Spain]], [[Latin America]], and the [[United States]], raising awareness and support for the cause of Cuban independence. His unification of the Cuban [[\u00e9migr\u00e9]] community, particularly in [[Florida]], was crucial to the success of the [[Cuban War of Independence]] against Spain. He was a key figure in the planning and execution of this war, as well as the designer of the [[Partido Revolucionario Cubano (1892)|Cuban Revolutionary Party]] and its ideology. He died in military action during the [[Battle of Dos R\u00edos]] on May 19, 1895. Mart\u00ed is considered one of the great turn-of-the-century Latin American intellectuals. His written works include a series of poems, essays, [[Letter (message)|letters]], lectures, a novel, and a [[Children's literature|children's magazine]].\n\nHe wrote for numerous Latin American and [[American newspapers]]; he also founded a number of newspapers. His newspaper ''Patria'' was an important instrument in his campaign for Cuban independence. After his death, many of his verses from the book, ''Versos Sencillos ([[Simple verses|Simple Verses]])'' were adapted to the song \"[[Guantanamera]]\", which has become a prominent representative song of Cuba. The concepts of [[Political freedom|freedom]], liberty, and [[democracy]] are prominent themes in all of his works, which were influential on the [[Nicaragua]]n poet [[Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo]] and the [[Chile]]an poet [[Gabriela Mistral]].<ref>Garganigo, John F.

Mart\u00ed was the older brother to seven sisters: Leonor, Mariana, Mar\u00eda del Carmen, Mar\u00eda del Pilar, Rita Amelia, Antonia and Dolores. He was baptized on February 12 in Santo \u00c1ngel Custodio church. When he was four, his family moved from Cuba to [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]], Spain, but two years later they returned to the island where they enrolled Jos\u00e9 at a local public school, in the Santa Clara neighborhood where his father worked as a prison guard.<ref name=\"alborch15\">{{harvnb|Alborch Bataller|1995|p= 15}}</ref>\n\nIn 1865, he enrolled in the Escuela de Instrucci\u00f3n Primaria Superior Municipal de Varones that was headed by Rafael Mar\u00eda de Mendive. Mendive was influential in the development of Mart\u00ed's political philosophies. Also instrumental in his development of a social and political conscience was his best friend Ferm\u00edn Vald\u00e9s Dom\u00ednguez, the son of a wealthy slave-owning family.<ref>Fidalgo 1998, p. 26</ref> In April the same year, after hearing the news of the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]], Mart\u00ed and other young students expressed their pain\u2014through group mourning\u2014for the death of a man who had decreed [[Abolition of slavery in the USA|the abolition of slavery]] in the United States. In 1866, Mart\u00ed entered the Instituto de Segunda Ense\u00f1anza where Mendive financed his studies.<ref name=\"alborch15\" />\n\nMart\u00ed signed up at the Escuela Profesional de Pintura y Escultura de La Habana (Professional School for Painting and Sculpture of Havana) in September 1867, known as San Alejandro, to take drawing classes. He hoped to flourish in this area but did not find commercial success. In 1867, he also entered the school of San Pablo, established and managed by Mendive, where he enrolled for the second and third years of his bachelor's degree and assisted Mendive with the school's administrative tasks. In April 1868, his poem dedicated to Mendive's wife, ''A Micaela.

Mart\u00ed had a precocious desire for the independence and freedom of Cuba. He started writing poems about this vision, while, at the same time, trying to do something to achieve this dream. In 1869, he published his first political writings in the only edition of the newspaper ''El Diablo Cojuelo'', published by Ferm\u00edn Vald\u00e9s Dom\u00ednguez. That same year he published \"Abdala\", a patriotic drama in [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] form in the one-volume ''La Patria Libre'' newspaper, which he published himself. \"Abdala\" is about a fictional country called Nubia which struggles for liberation.<ref>{{harvnb|L\u00f3pez|2006|p= 232}}</ref> His sonnet \"10 de Octubre\", later to become one of his most famous poems, was also written during that year, and was published later in his school newspaper.<ref name=\"alborch16\" />\n\n[[File:JoseMartiStatue-CentralParkNY.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Equestrian statue of Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed (Central Park)|Statue of Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed on horseback]] in New York's Central Park \u2013 [[Anna Hyatt Huntington]], 1959]]\n\nIn March of that year, colonial authorities shut down the school, interrupting Mart\u00ed's studies. He came to resent [[Spanish Cuba|Spanish rule of his homeland]] at an early age; likewise, he developed a hatred of slavery, which was still [[Slavery in Cuba|practiced in Cuba]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyofcuba.com/history/race/EndSlave.htm |title=End of Slavery in Cuba|website=www.historyofcuba.com|access-date=2019-07-22}}</ref>\n\nOn October 21, 1869, aged 16, he was arrested and incarcerated in the national jail, following an accusation of [[treason]] and bribery from the Spanish government upon the discovery of a \"reproving\" letter, which Mart\u00ed and Ferm\u00edn had written to a friend when the friend joined the Spanish army.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1953|p= 398}}</ref> More than four months later, Mart\u00ed confessed to the charges and was condemned to six years in prison. His mother tried to free her son (who at 16 was still a minor) by writing letters to the government, and his father went to a lawyer friend for legal support, but these efforts failed. Eventually, Mart\u00ed fell ill; his legs were severely lacerated by the chains that bound him. As a result, he was transferred to another part of Cuba known as [[Isla de Pinos]] instead of further imprisonment. Following that, the Spanish authorities decided to exile him to Spain.<ref name=\"alborch16\" /> In Spain, Mart\u00ed, who was 18 at the time, was allowed to continue his studies with the hopes that studying in Spain would renew his loyalty to Spain.<ref>{{harvnb|Alborch Bataller|1995|p= 18}}</ref>\n[[File:Jose marti-DF.jpg|thumb|alt=|monument of Jose Mart\u00ed in [[Mexico City]]]]\n\n===Spain: 1871\u201374===\n[[File:A Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed en la alameda Marqu\u00e9s de Comillas de C\u00e1diz.JPG|thumb|175px|Monument of Mart\u00ed in [[C\u00e1diz]], [[Spain]]]]\nIn January 1871, Mart\u00ed embarked on the steam ship ''Guipuzcoa'', which took him from Havana to [[C\u00e1diz]]. He settled in [[Madrid]] in a guesthouse in Desenga\u00f1o St. #10. Arriving at the capitol he contacted fellow Cuban Carlos Sauvalle, who had been deported to Spain a year before Mart\u00ed and whose house served as a center of reunions for Cubans in exile. On March 24, C\u00e1diz's newspaper ''La Soberania Nacional'', published Mart\u00ed's article \"Castillo\" in which he recalled the sufferings of a friend he met in prison. This article would be reprinted in [[Seville|Sevilla]]'s ''La Cuesti\u00f3n Cubana'' and [[New York City|New York]]'s ''La Rep\u00fablica''.

This pamphlet's purpose was to move the Spanish public to do something about its government's brutalities in Cuba and promoted the issue of Cuban independence.<ref>{{harvnb|Mart\u00ed|1963a|p= 48}}</ref> In September, from the pages of ''El Jurado Federal'', Mart\u00ed and Sauvalle accused the newspaper ''La Prensa'' of having calumniated the Cuban residents in Madrid. During his stay in Madrid, Mart\u00ed frequented the Ateneo and the [[National Library of Spain|National Library]], the Caf\u00e9 de los Artistas, and the British, Swiss and Iberian breweries. In November he became sick and had an operation, paid for by Sauvalle.<ref name=\"alborch23\" />\n\nOn November 27, 1871, eight medical students, who had been accused (without evidence) of the desecration of a Spanish grave, were executed in Havana.<ref name=\"alborch23\" /> In June 1872, Ferm\u00edn Vald\u00e9s was arrested because of the November 27 incident. His sentence of six years of jail was pardoned, and he was exiled to Spain where he reunited with Mart\u00ed. On November 27, 1872, the printed matter ''Dia 27 de Noviembre de 1871'' (27 November 1871) written by Mart\u00ed and signed by Ferm\u00edn Vald\u00e9s Dom\u00ednguez and Pedro J. de la Torre circulated Madrid.

In February, for the first time, the [[Cuban flag]] appeared in Madrid, hanging from Mart\u00ed's balcony in Concepci\u00f3n Jer\u00f3nima, where he lived for a few years. In the same month, the [[First Spanish Republic#Proclamation of the Republic|Proclamation of the First Spanish Republic]] by the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] on February 11, 1873 reaffirmed Cuba as inseparable to Spain, Mart\u00ed responded with an essay, ''The Spanish Republic and the Cuban Revolution'', and sent it to the Prime Minister, pointing out that this new freely elected body of deputies that had proclaimed a republic based on democracy had been hypocritical not to grant Cuba its independence.<ref>P\u00e9rez-Gald\u00f3s Ortiz 1999, p. 45</ref> He sent examples of his work to [[Nestor Ponce de Leon]], a member of the Junta Central Revolucionaria de Nueva York (Central revolutionary committee of New York), to whom he would express his will to collaborate on the fight for the independence of Cuba.<ref name=\"alborch24\" />\n\nIn May, he moved to [[Zaragoza]], accompanied by Ferm\u00edn Vald\u00e9s to continue his studies in law at the Universidad Literaria.

One floor above him lived [[Manuel Mercado|Manuel Antonio Mercado]], Secretary of the [[Mexican Federal District|Distrito Federal]], who became one of Mart\u00ed's best friends. On March 2, 1875, he published his first article for Vicente Villada's ''Revista Universal'', a broadsheet discussing politics, literature, and general business commerce. On March 12, his Spanish translation of Hugo's ''Mes Fils'' (1874) began serialization in ''Revista Universal''. Mart\u00ed then joined the editorial staff, editing the ''Bolet\u00edn'' section of the publication.\n\nIn these writings, he expressed his opinions about current events in Mexico. On May 27, in the newspaper ''Revista Universal'', he responded to the anti-Cuban-independence arguments in ''La Colonia Espa\u00f1ola'', a newspaper for Spanish citizens living in Mexico. In December, Sociedad Gorostiza (Gorostiza Society), a group of writers and artists, accepted Mart\u00ed as a member, where he met his future wife, Carmen Zayas Baz\u00e1n, during his frequent visits to her Cuban father's house to meet with the Gorostiza group.<ref name=\"alborch46\">{{harvnb|Alborch Bataller|1995|p= 46}}</ref>\n\nOn January 1, 1876, in [[Oaxaca]], elements opposed to [[Sebasti\u00e1n Lerdo de Tejada]]'s government, led by Gen. [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]], proclaimed the [[Plan of Tuxtepec|Plan de Tuxtepec]], which instigated a bloody civil war. Mart\u00ed and Mexican colleagues established the Sociedad Alarc\u00f3n, composed of dramatists, actors, and critics. At this point, Mart\u00ed began collaborating with the newspaper ''El Socialista'' as leader of the Gran C\u00edrculo Obrero (Great Labor Circle) organization of liberals and reformists who supported Lerdo de Tejada. In March, the newspaper proposed a series of candidates as delegates, including Mart\u00ed, to the first Congreso Obrero, or congress of the workers. On June 4, La Sociedad Esperanza de Empleados (Employees' Hope Society) designated Mart\u00ed as delegate to the Congreso Obrero. On December 7, Mart\u00ed published his article ''Alea Jacta Est'' in the newspaper ''El Federalista'', bitterly criticizing the [[List of factions in the Mexican Revolution|Porfiristas]]' armed assault upon the constitutional government in place. On December 16, he published the article \"Extranjero\" (foreigner; abroad), in which he repeated his denunciation of the Porfiristas and bade farewell to Mexico.<ref name=\"alborch46\" />\n\nIn 1877, using his second name and second surname<ref name=\"surnames\">It is common, and in fact legal, practice in Spanish-speaking societies to use and include the maternal surname as the \"second\" last name, such that both surnames are the legal and customary surname of an individual. E.g., P\u00e9rez L\u00f3pez means that in ''non''-Spanish societies esp. anglophone societies, '''P\u00e9rez''' is the correct surname to which to refer; otherwise, 'both' names together are the legal surname.</ref> Juli\u00e1n P\u00e9rez as pseudonym, Mart\u00ed embarked for Havana, hoping to arrange to move his family away to Mexico City from Havana. He returned to Mexico, however, entering at the port of [[Progreso, Yucat\u00e1n|Progreso]] from which, via [[Isla Mujeres|Isla de Mujeres]] and [[Belize]], he travelled south to progressive [[Guatemala City]]. He took residence in the prosperous suburb of [[Ciudad Vieja]], home of Guatemala's artists and intelligentsia of the day, on Cuarta Avenida (Fourth Avenue), 3&nbsp;km south of Guatemala City. While there, he was commissioned by the government to write the play ''Patria y Libertad (Drama Indio)'' (Country and Liberty (an Indian Drama)). He met personally the president, [[Justo Rufino Barrios]], about this project. On April 22, the newspaper ''El Progreso'' published his article ''\"Los c\u00f3digos Nuevos\"'' (The New Laws) pertaining to the then newly enacted Civil Code. On May 29, he was appointed head of the Department of French, English, Italian and German Literature, History and Philosophy, on the faculty of philosophy and arts of the [[University of San Carlos of Guatemala|Universidad Nacional]]. On July 25, he lectured for the opening evening of the literary society 'Sociedad Literaria El Porvenir', at the Teatro Col\u00f3n (the since-renamed [[Centro Cultural Miguel \u00c1ngel Asturias|Teatro Nacional]]<ref name=\"musica\">Guatemala was one of the first regions of the New World to be exposed to European music</ref>), at which function he was appointed vice-president of the Society, and acquiring the moniker \"el doctor torrente,\" or Doctor Torrent, in view of his rhetorical style. Mart\u00ed taught composition classes free at the A''cademia de Ni\u00f1as de Centroam\u00e9rica'' girls' academy, among whose students he enthralled young [[Mar\u00eda Garc\u00eda Granados y Sabor\u00edo]], daughter of Guatemalan president [[Miguel Garc\u00eda Granados]]. The schoolgirl's crush was unrequited, however, as he went again to M\u00e9xico, where he met Carmen Zayas Baz\u00e1n and whom he later married.<ref>{{harvnb|Alborch Bataller|1995|p= 52}}</ref>\n\nIn 1878, Mart\u00ed returned to Guatemala and published his book ''Guatemala'', edited in Mexico. On May 10, socialite Mar\u00eda Garc\u00eda Granados died of lung disease; her unrequited love for Mart\u00ed branded her, poignantly, as 'la ni\u00f1a de Guatemala, la que se muri\u00f3 de amor' (the Guatemalan girl who died of love). Following her death, Mart\u00ed returned to Cuba. There, he resigned signing the [[Pact of Zanj\u00f3n]] which ended the Cuban [[Ten Years' War]], but had no effect on Cuba's status as a colony. He met [[Afro-Cubans|Afro-Cuban]] revolutionary [[Juan Gualberto G\u00f3mez]], who would be his lifelong partner in the independence struggle and a stalwart defender of his legacy during this same journey. He married Carmen Zayas Baz\u00e1n on Havana's Calle Tulip\u00e1n Street at this time. In October, his application to practice law in Cuba was refused, and thereafter he immersed himself in radical efforts, such as for the Comit\u00e9 Revolucionario Cubano de Nueva York (Cuban Revolutionary Committee of New York). On November 22, 1878 his son Jos\u00e9 Francisco, known fondly as \"Pepito\", was born.<ref name=\"alborch56\">{{harvnb|Alborch Bataller|1995|p= 56}}</ref>\n\n===United States and Venezuela: 1880\u201390===\nIn 1881, after a brief stay in New York, Mart\u00ed travelled to [[Venezuela]] and founded in [[Caracas]] the ''Revista Venezolana'', or Venezuelan Review. The journal incurred the wrath of Venezuela's dictator, [[Antonio Guzm\u00e1n Blanco]], and Mart\u00ed was forced to return to New York.<ref name=\"alborch107\">{{harvnb|Alborch Bataller|1995|p= 107}}</ref> There, Mart\u00ed joined General [[Calixto Garc\u00eda]]'s Cuban revolutionary committee, composed of Cuban exiles advocating independence. Here Mart\u00ed openly supported Cuba's struggle for liberation, and worked as a journalist for ''La Naci\u00f3n'' of [[Buenos Aires]] and for several Central American journals,<ref name=\"jones399\" /> especially ''La Opinion Liberal'' in Mexico City.<ref>{{harvnb|Gray|1966|p= 389}}</ref> The article \"El ajusticiamiento de [[Charles J.

Garfield|President Garfield]]'s murderer's trial, was published in ''La Opinion Liberal'' in 1881, and later selected for inclusion in [[The Library of America]]'s anthology of American True Crime writing. In addition, Mart\u00ed wrote poems and translated novels to Spanish. He worked for Appleton and Company and, \"on his own, translated and published Helen Hunt Jackson's ''Ramona''. His repertory of original work included plays, a novel, poetry, a children's magazine, ''La Edad de Oro'', and a newspaper, ''Patria'', which became the official organ of the [[Partido Revolucionario Cubano (1892)|Cuban Revolutionary party]]\".<ref name=\"gray390\">{{harvnb|Gray|1966|p= 390}}</ref> He also served as a consul for Uruguay, Argentina, and Paraguay. Throughout this work, he preached the \"freedom of Cuba with an enthusiasm that swelled the ranks of those eager to strive with him for it\".<ref name=\"jones399\" />\n\nTension existed within the Cuban revolutionary committee between Mart\u00ed and his military compatriots. Mart\u00ed feared a [[military dictatorship]] would be established in Cuba upon independence, and suspected Dominican-born General [[M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez]] of having these intentions.<ref>{{harvnb|Garc\u00eda Cisneros|1986|p= 56}}</ref> Mart\u00ed knew that the independence of Cuba needed time and careful planning. Ultimately, Mart\u00ed refused to cooperate with [[M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez]] and [[Antonio Maceo Grajales]], two Cuban military leaders from the [[Ten Years' War]], when they wanted to invade immediately in 1884. Mart\u00ed knew that it was too early to attempt to win back Cuba, and later events proved him right.<ref name=\"jones399\" />\n\n===United States, Central America and the West Indies: 1891\u201394===\nOn January 1, 1891, Mart\u00ed's essay \"Nuestra America\" was published in New York's ''Revista Ilustrada'', and on the 30th of that month in Mexico's ''El Partido Liberal''. He actively participated in the Conferencia Monetaria Internacional (The International Monetary Conference) in New York during that time as well. On June 30 his wife and son arrived in New York. After a short time, during which Carmen Zayas Baz\u00e1n realized that Mart\u00ed's dedication to Cuban independence surpassed that of supporting his family, she returned to Havana with her son on August 27. Mart\u00ed would never see them again. The fact that his wife never shared the convictions central to his life was an enormous personal tragedy for Mart\u00ed.<ref>{{harvnb|Fountain|2003|p= 4}}</ref> He turned for solace to Carmen Miyares de Mantilla, a Venezuelan who ran a boarding house in New York, and he is presumed to be the father of her daughter Mar\u00eda Mantilla, who was in turn the mother of the actor [[Cesar Romero]], who proudly claimed to be Mart\u00ed's grandson. In September Mart\u00ed became sick again. He intervened in the commemorative acts of The Independents, causing the Spanish consul in New York to complain to the Argentine and Uruguayan governments. Consequently, Mart\u00ed resigned from the Argentinean, Paraguayan, and Uruguayan consulates. In October he published his book ''Versos Sencillos''.\n\n[[File:Jose Marti in Ybor City.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed (center) with cigar workers in [[Ybor City]], [[Tampa, Florida]] ]]\nOn November 26 he was invited by the ''Club Ignacio Agramonte'', an organization founded by Cuban immigrants in [[Ybor City]], [[Tampa, Florida]], to a celebration to collect funding for the cause of Cuban independence. There he gave a lecture known as ''\"Con Todos, y para el Bien de Todos\"'', which was reprinted in Spanish language newspapers and periodicals across the United States. The following night, another lecture, ''\" Los Pinos Nuevos\"'', was given by Mart\u00ed in another Tampa gathering in honor of the medical students killed in Cuba in 1871. In November artist Herman Norman painted a portrait of Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed.<ref name=\"alborch159\">{{harvnb|Alborch Bataller|1995|p= 159}}</ref>\n\nOn January 5, 1892, Mart\u00ed participated in a reunion of the emigration representatives, in [[Key West|Cayo Hueso]] (Key West), the Cuban community where the ''Bases del Partido Revolucionario'' (Basis of the Cuban Revolutionary Party) was passed. He began the process of organizing the newly formed party. To raise support and collect funding for the independence movement, he visited tobacco factories, where he gave speeches to the workers and united them in the cause. In March 1892 the first edition of the ''Patria'' newspaper, related to the Cuban Revolutionary Party, was published, funded and directed by Mart\u00ed. During Mart\u00ed's Key West years, his secretary was Dolores Castellanos (1870-1948), a [[Cuban Americans|Cuban-American]] woman born in Key West, who also served as president of the Protectoras de la Patria: Club Pol\u00edtico de Cubanas, a Cuban women's political club in support of Mart\u00ed's cause, and for whom Mart\u00ed wrote a poem titled \"[http://www.josemarti.cu/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/0110_A_DOLORES_CASTELLANOS.pdf A Dolores Castellanos].\" On April 8, he was chosen delegate of the [[Partido Revolucionario Cubano (1892)|Cuban Revolutionary Party]] by the Cayo Hueso Club in Tampa and New York.\n\nFrom July to September 1892 he traveled through Florida, [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Haiti]], the [[Dominican Republic]] and Jamaica on an organization mission among the exiled Cubans. On this mission, Mart\u00ed made numerous speeches and visited various tobacco factories. On December 16 he was poisoned in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]].<ref name=\"alborch167\">{{harvnb|Alborch Bataller|1995|p= 167}}</ref>\n\nIn 1893, Mart\u00ed traveled through the United States, Central America and the West Indies, visiting different Cuban clubs. His visits were received with a growing enthusiasm and raised badly needed funds for the revolutionary cause. On May 24 he met [[Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo]], the Nicaraguan poet in a theatre act in Hardman Hall, New York City. On June 3 he had an interview with [[M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez]] in [[Monte Cristi, Dominican Republic|Montecristi]], Dominican Republic, where they planned the uprising. In July he met with General [[Antonio Maceo Grajales]] in San Jose, Costa Rica.<ref name=\"alborch167\" />\n\nIn 1894 he continued traveling for propagation and organizing the revolutionary movement. On January 27 he published ''\"A Cuba!\"'' in the newspaper ''Patria'' where he denounced collusion between the Spanish and American interests. In July he visited the president of the Mexican Republic, [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]], and travelled to [[Veracruz]]. In August he prepared and arranged the armed expedition that would begin the Cuban revolution.<ref name=\"alborch184\">{{harvnb|Alborch Bataller|1995|p= 184}}</ref>\n\n===Return to Cuba: 1895===\n[[File:Cuba 1915 5 Pesos (obv).jpg|thumb|Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed depicted on the 1915 gold 5 [[Cuban peso]] coin.]]\n[[File:Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed busto El Rosedal.jpg|thumb|alt=|[[Buenos Aires]].]]\nOn January 12, 1895, the North American authorities stopped the steamship ''Lagonda'' and two other suspicious ships, ''Amadis'' and ''Baracoa'', at the port of Fernandina in Florida, confiscating weapons and ruining Plan de Fernandina (Fernandina Plan). On January 29, Mart\u00ed drew up the order of the uprising, signing it with general [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez Rodr\u00edguez|Jose Maria Rodriguez]] and Enrique Collazo. [[Juan Gualberto G\u00f3mez]] was assigned to orchestrate war preparations for La Habana Province, and was able to work right under the noses of the relatively unconcerned Spanish authorities.<ref>{{harvnb|Tone|2006|p=43}}</ref> Mart\u00ed decided to move to Montecristi, Dominican Republic to join [[M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez]] and to plan out the uprising.<ref name=\"alborch191\">{{harvnb|Alborch Bataller|1995|p= 191}}</ref>\n\nThe uprising finally took place on February 24, 1895.

Knowing that the majority of his writing in newspapers in Honduras, Uruguay, and Chile would disappear over time, Mart\u00ed instructed Quesada to arrange his papers in volumes. The volumes were to be arranged in the following way: volumes one and two, North Americas; volume three, Hispanic Americas; volume four, North American Scenes; volume five, Books about the Americas (this included both North and South America); volume six, Literature, education and painting. Another volume included his poetry.<ref name=\"gray391\" />\n[[File:Jose Marti Jesus Maria Lima Pe.jpg|thumb|alt=|[[Lima]], Peru]]\nThe expedition, composed of Mart\u00ed, G\u00f3mez, \u00c1ngel Guerra, Francisco Borreo, Cesar Salas and Marcos del Rosario, left Montecristi for Cuba on April 1, 1895.<ref name=\"alborch191\"/> Despite delays and desertion by some members, they got to Cuba, landing at Playitas, near [[Cape Mais\u00ed]] and [[Im\u00edas]], Cuba, on April 11.

G\u00f3mez had recognized that the Spaniards had a strong position between palm trees, so he ordered his men to disengage. Mart\u00ed was alone and seeing a young courier ride by said: \"Joven, \u00a1a la carga!\" meaning: \"Young man, charge!\" This was around midday, and he was dressed in a black jacket while riding a white horse, which made him an easy target for the Spanish. After Mart\u00ed was shot, the young trooper, Angel de la Guardia, lost his horse and returned to report the loss. The Spanish took possession of the body, buried it close by, then exhumed the body upon realization of its identity. He was buried in [[Santa Ifigenia Cemetery]] in [[Santiago de Cuba]]. Many have argued that Maceo and others had always spurned Mart\u00ed for never participating in combat, which may have compelled Mart\u00ed to that ill-fated two-man charge. Some of his ''Versos Sencillos'' can seem premonition-like: \"No me entierren en lo oscuro/\nA morir como un traidor/\nYo soy bueno y como bueno/\nMorir\u00e9 de cara al sol.\"\n(\"Do not bury me in darkness / to die like a traitor / I am good, and as a good man /\nI will die facing the sun.\")\n\nThe death of Mart\u00ed was a blow to the \"aspirations of the Cuban rebels, inside and outside of the island, but the fighting continued with alternating successes and failures until the entry of the United States into the war in 1898\".<ref name=\"gray392\">{{harvnb|Gray|1966|p= 392}}</ref>\n\n==Political ideology==\n[[File:Memorial Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, Cuba.jpg|thumb|200px|Statue of Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed in [[Havana, Cuba]]]]\n\n===Liberalism===\nMart\u00ed's political ideas were shaped by his early encounter with [[Krausism|Krausist]] liberalism and its defense of spirituality and solidarity.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nuccetelli |first1=Susana |title=An Introduction to Latin American Philosophy |date=2020 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=139\u2013145}}</ref><ref name=\"Ortega\">{{cite journal |last1=Ortega Paredes |first1=Juan J. |title=Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed: su concepto de democracia en el Partido Revolucionario Cubano |journal=Revista de Ciencias Sociales |date=2007 |volume=115 |page=100}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Jorrin |first1=Miguel |title=Latin American Political Thought and Ideology |date=1970 |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |pages=161\u2013162}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Conde |first1=Guillermo Hierrezuelo |title=Il pensiero politico di Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed |journal=Revista de Estudios Hist\u00f3ricos - Juridicos |date=2014 |issue=36 |pages=518\u2013521|doi=10.4067/S0716-54552014000100020 |doi-access=free }}</ref> [[Radicalism (historical)|Radical liberalism]] in Latin America during this time period often took on a nationalist and anti-imperialist cast, as shown by the examples of [[Francisco Bilbao]] in Chile, [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] in Mexico, [[Jos\u00e9 Santos Zelaya]] in Nicaragua, and [[Ram\u00f3n Emeterio Betances]] in Puerto Rico, whom Mart\u00ed deeply admired and considered one of his teachers.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Arroyo |first1=Jossianna |title=Writing Secrecy in Caribbean Freemasonry |date=2013 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |pages=102}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hidalgo Paz |first1=Ibrahim |title=Puerto Rico en el Partido Revolucionario Cubano, 1895-1898 |journal=Revista de la Biblioteca Nacional Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed |date=2008 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=87\u2013100}}</ref> An increasingly radicalized liberalism emphasizing democratic participation, economic equality, national sovereignty, and supplemented by his exposure to doctrines such as [[Georgism]], remained the dominant basis of Mart\u00ed's outlook.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Abel |first1=Christopher |title=Jos\u00e9 Marti: Revolutionary Democrat |date=2015 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |pages=137\u2013139}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Fernandez |first1=Raul A. |title=Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed's \"Our America\": From National to Hemispheric Cultural Studies |date=1998 |publisher=Duke University Press |page=215}}</ref>\n\n===Cuban independence===\nMart\u00ed wrote extensively about Spanish colonial control and the threat of [[American imperialism|US expansionism]] into [[Cuba]]. To him, it was unnatural that Cuba was controlled and oppressed by the Spanish government, when it had its own unique identity and culture. In his pamphlet from February 11, 1873, called \"The Spanish Republic and the Cuban Revolution\", he argued that \"Cubans do not live as Spaniards live.... They are nourished by a different system of trade, have links with different countries, and express their happiness through quite contrary customs. There are no common aspirations or identical goals linking the two peoples, or beloved memories to unite them. ... Peoples are only united by ties of fraternity and love.\".<ref>{{harvnb|Mart\u00ed|1963b|pp=93\u201394}}</ref>\n\n===Slavery===\nMart\u00ed opposed slavery and criticized Spain for upholding it. In a speech to Cuban immigrants in Steck Hall, New York, on January 24, 1879, he stated that the war against Spain needed to be fought, recalled the heroism and suffering of the [[Ten Years' War]], which, he declared, had qualified Cuba as a real nation with a right to independence. Spain had not ratified the conditions of the peace treaty, had falsified elections, continued excessive taxation, and had failed to abolish slavery. Cuba needed to be free.<ref>{{harvnb|Scott|1984|p= 87}}</ref>\n\n===Revolutionary tactics===\nMart\u00ed proposed in a letter to [[M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez]] in 1882 the formation of a revolutionary party, which he considered essential in the prevention of Cuba falling back on the Home Rule Party (''Partido Autonomista'') after the [[Pact of Zanj\u00f3n]].<ref>Ramos 2001, pp. 34\u201335</ref> The Home Rule Party was a peace-seeking party that would stop short of the outright independence that Mart\u00ed thought Cuba needed. But he was aware that there were social divisions in Cuba, especially racial divisions, that needed to be addressed as well.<ref>{{harvnb|Mart\u00ed|1963c|p= 172}}</ref> He thought war was necessary to achieve Cuba's freedom, despite his basic ideology of conciliation, respect, dignity, and balance. The establishment of the ''patria'' (fatherland) with a good government would unite Cubans of all social classes and colours in harmony.<ref>{{harvnb|Mart\u00ed|1963d|p= 192}}</ref> Together with other Cubans resident in New York, Mart\u00ed started laying the grounds for the Revolutionary Party, stressing the need for a democratic organization as the basic structure before any military leaders were to join. The military would have to subordinate themselves to the interests of the fatherland. G\u00f3mez later rejoined Mart\u00ed's plans, promising to comply.\n\nMart\u00ed's consolidation of support among the Cuban expatriates, especially in Florida, was key in the planning and execution of the invasion of Cuba. His speeches to Cuban tobacco workers in Tampa and Key West motivated and united them; this is considered the most important political achievement of his life.<ref>Ronning 1990, p. 103</ref> At this point he refined his ideological platform, basing it on a Cuba held together by pride in being Cuban, a society that ensured \"the welfare and prosperity of all Cubans\"<ref>{{harvnb|Mart\u00ed|1963e|p= 270}}</ref> independently of class, occupation or race. Faith in the cause could not die, and the military would not try for domination. All pro-independence Cubans would participate, with no sector predominating. From this he established the [[Partido Revolucionario Cubano (1892)|Cuban Revolutionary Party]] in early 1892.\n\nMart\u00ed and the CRP were devoted to secretly organizing the anti-Spanish war. Mart\u00ed's newspaper, ''Patria'', was a key instrument of this campaign, where Mart\u00ed delineated his final plans for Cuba. Through this medium he argued against the exploitative colonialism of Spain in Cuba, criticized the Home Rule (''Autonomista'') Party for having aims that fell considerably short of full independence, and warned against U.S. annexationism which he felt could only be prevented by Cuba's successful independence.<ref>{{harvnb|Bueno|1997|p= 158}}</ref> He specified his plans for the future Cuban Republic, a multi-class and multi-racial democratic republic based on universal suffrage, with an egalitarian economic base to develop fully Cuba's productive resources and an equitable distribution of land among citizens, with enlightened and virtuous politicians.<ref>Abel 1986, p. 26</ref>\n\nFrom Mart\u00ed's 'Campaign Diaries', written during the final expedition in Cuba, it seems evident that Mart\u00ed would have reached the highest position in the future Republic of Arms.<ref name=\"turton57\">{{harvnb|Turton|1986|p=57}}</ref> This was not to be; his death occurred before the Assembly of Cuba was set up. Until his last minute, Mart\u00ed dedicated his life to achieve full independence for Cuba. His uncompromising belief in democracy and freedom for his fatherland is what characterized his political ideology.\n\n===United States===\n[[File:JoseMartimonumentweehawken.jpg|thumb|200px|Monument of Mart\u00ed in [[West New York, NJ]]. Translated, it reads \"The Fatherland is an altar, not a stepping stone.\"]]\n[[File:Estatua de Jose Marti en Ybor City.jpg|thumb|alt=|Monument of Jose Mart\u00ed in [[Ybor City]] ([[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], Florida).]]\nMart\u00ed demonstrated an [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] attitude from an early age, and was convinced that the United States posed a danger for Latin America. While critiquing the United States for its stereotypes of Latin Americans and preoccupation with [[capitalism]], Mart\u00ed also drew parallels with the [[American Revolution]] and the nationalist movement in Cuba.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Giles|first1=Paul|date=Spring 2004|title=The Parallel Worlds of Jose Marti|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/169486/pdf|journal=Radical History Review|volume=2004|issue=89|pages=185\u2013190|doi=10.1215/01636545-2004-89-185|s2cid=144839689|access-date=16 November 2017}}</ref> At the same time, he recognized the advantages of the European or North American civilizations, which were open to the reforms that Latin American countries needed in order to detach themselves from the colonial heritage of Spain. Mart\u00ed's distrust of North American politics had developed during the 1880s, due to the intervention threats that loomed on Mexico and Guatemala, and indirectly on Cuba's future. Over time Mart\u00ed became increasingly alarmed about the United States' intentions for Cuba. The United States desperately needed new markets for its industrial products because of the economic crisis it was experiencing, and the media was talking about the purchase of Cuba from Spain.<ref>Holden & Zolov 2000, p. 249</ref> Cuba was a profitable, fertile country with an important strategic position in the Gulf of Mexico.<ref>Turton 1986, p. 47</ref> Mart\u00ed felt that the interests of Cuba's future lay with its sister nations in Latin America, and were opposite to those of the United States.<ref>{{harvnb|Holden|Solov|2000|p=179}}</ref>\n\nAnother trait that Mart\u00ed admired was the work ethic that characterized North American society. On various occasions Mart\u00ed conveyed his deep admiration for the immigrant-based society, \"whose principal aspiration he interpreted as being to construct a truly modern country, based upon hard work and progressive ideas.\" Mart\u00ed stated that he was \"never surprised in any country of the world [he had] visited. Here [he] was surprised... [he] remarked that no one stood quietly on the corners, no door was shut an instant, no man was quiet. [He] stopped [him]self, [he] looked respectfully on this people, and [he] said goodbye forever to that lazy life and poetical inutility of our European countries\".<ref name=\"kirk278\">{{harvnb|Kirk|1977|p=278}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Mart\u00ed opposed US intervention in Cuba, he found American society to be so great that he believed Latin America should consider imitating the United States. Mart\u00ed argued that if the US \"could reach such a high standard of living in so short a time, and despite, too, its lack of unifying traditions, could not the same be expected of Latin America?\"<ref name=\"kirk278\" /> However, Mart\u00ed believed US expansionism represented Spanish American republics' \"greatest danger.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Kirk|1977|pp=278\u201379}} Mart\u00ed thought that US expansionism represented the Spanish American republics' \"greatest danger\"</ref> Mart\u00ed was amazed at how education was directed towards helping the development of the nation and once again encouraged Latin American countries to follow the example set by North American society. At the same time, he criticized the elitist educational systems of Cuba and the rest of Latin America. Often, Mart\u00ed recommended countries in Latin America to \"send representatives to learn more relevant techniques in the United States\". Once this was done, Mart\u00ed hoped that this representatives would bring a \"much-needed modernization to the Latin American agricultural policies\".<ref name=\"kirk279\">{{harvnb|Kirk|1977|p= 279}}</ref>\n\nHowever, not everything in the United States was to be admired by Mart\u00ed. When it came to politics Mart\u00ed wrote that politics in the US had \"adopted a carnival atmosphere... especially during election time\".<ref name=\"kirk280\">{{harvnb|Kirk|1977|p= 280}}</ref> He saw acts of corruption among candidates, such as bribing \"the constituents with vast quantities of beer, while impressive parades wound their way through New York's crowded streets, past masses of billboards, all exhorting the public to vote for the different political candidates\".<ref name=\"kirk280\" /> Mart\u00ed criticized and condemned the elites of the United States as they \"pulled the main political strings behind the scenes\". According to Mart\u00ed, the elites \"deserved severe censure\" as they were the biggest threat to the \"ideals with which the United States was first conceived\".<ref name=\"kirk280\" />\n\nMart\u00ed started to believe that the US had abused its potential. [[Racism in the United States|Racism]] was abundant. Different races were being discriminated against; political life \"was both cynically regarded by the public at large and widely abused by 'professional politicians'; industrial magnates and powerful labor groups faced each other menacingly\". All of this convinced Mart\u00ed that a large-scale social conflict was imminent in the United States.<ref>{{harvnb|Kirk|1977|p= 281}}</ref>\n\nOn the positive side, Mart\u00ed was astonished by the \"inviolable right of freedom of speech which all U.S. citizens possessed\". Mart\u00ed applauded the United States' Constitution which allowed freedom of speech to all its citizens, no matter what political beliefs they had. In May 1883, while attending political meetings he heard \"the call for revolution \u2013 and more specifically the destruction of the capitalist system\". Mart\u00ed was amazed that the country maintained freedom of speech even with respect to calls that \"could have led to its own destruction\". Mart\u00ed also gave his support to the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]] movements, and was \"pleased that women here [took] advantage of this privilege in order to make their voices heard\". According to Mart\u00ed, free speech was essential if any nation was to be civilized and he expressed his \"profound admiration for these many basic liberties and opportunities open to the vast majority of U.S. citizens\".<ref name=\"kirk282\">{{harvnb|Kirk|1977|p= 282}}</ref>\n\nThe works of Mart\u00ed contain many comparisons between the ways of life of North and Latin America. The former was seen as \"hardy, 'soulless', and, at times, cruel society, but one which, nevertheless, had been based upon a firm foundation of liberty and on a tradition of liberty\".<ref name=\"kirk282\" /> Although North American society had its flaws, they tended to be \"of minor importance when compared to the broad sweep of social inequality, and to the widespread abuse of power prevalent in Latin America\".<ref name=\"kirk282\" />\n\nOnce it became apparent that the United States were actually going to purchase Cuba and intended to [[Americanization|Americanize]] it, Mart\u00ed \"spoke out loudly and bravely against such action, stating the opinion of many Cubans on the United States of America.\"<ref name=\"kirk284\">{{harvnb|Kirk|1977|p=284}}</ref>\n\n===Latin American identity===\n[[File:Marti Monument EUR Rome.jpg|thumb|Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed Monument at [[Esposizione Universale Roma]], [[Rome]]]]\nJos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed as a liberator believed that the Latin American countries needed to know the reality of their own history. Mart\u00ed also saw the necessity of a country having its own literature. These reflections started in Mexico from 1875 and are connected to the Mexican Reform, where prominent liberals like [[Ignacio Manuel Altamirano]] and [[Guillermo Prieto]] had situated themselves in front of a cultural renovation in Mexico, taking on the same approach as [[Esteban Echeverr\u00eda]] thirty years before in Argentina. In the second \"Boletin\" that Mart\u00ed published in the ''Revista Universal'' (May 11, 1875) one can already see Mart\u00ed's approach, which was fundamentally Latin American. His wish to build a national or Latin American identity was nothing new or unusual in those days; however, no Latin-American intellectual of that time had approached as clearly as Mart\u00ed the task of building a national identity. He insisted on the necessity of building institutions and laws that matched the natural elements of each country, and recalled the failure of the applications of French and American civil codes in the new Latin American republics. Mart\u00ed believed that \"el hombre del sur\", the man of the South, should choose an appropriate development strategy matching his character, the peculiarity of his culture and history, and the nature that determined his being.<ref>{{harvnb|Fern\u00e1ndez|1995|p= 46}}{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}<!--Is this 1995 or 1997??--></ref>\n\n==Writings==\n\nMart\u00ed as a writer covered a range of genres. In addition to producing newspaper articles and keeping up an extensive correspondence (his letters are included in the collection of his complete works), he wrote a serialized novel, composed poetry, wrote essays, and published four issues of a children's magazine, ''La Edad de Oro''<ref>Lally, Carolyn. \"Foreign Language Program Articulation: Current Practice and Future Prospects.\" 2001. p. 54.</ref>(The Golden Age, 1889). His essays and articles occupy more than fifty volumes of his complete works. His prose was extensively read and influenced the modernist generation, especially the Nicaraguan poet Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo, whom Mart\u00ed called \"my son\" when they met in New York in 1893.<ref>Garganigo et al., p. 272{{Clarify|date=November 2008}}<!--who's the author, what's the title of the piece in this anthology?--></ref>\n\nMart\u00ed did not publish any books: only two notebooks (''Cuadernos'') of verses, in editions outside of the market, and a number of political tracts. The rest (an enormous amount) was left dispersed in numerous newspapers and magazines, in letters, in diaries and personal notes, in other unedited texts, in frequently improvised speeches, and some lost forever. Five years after his death, the first volume of his ''Obras'' was published. A novel appeared in this collection in 1911: ''Amistad funesta'', which Mart\u00ed had made known was published under a pseudonym in 1885. In 1913, also in this edition, his third poetic collection that he had kept unedited: ''Versos Libres''. His ''Diario de Campa\u00f1a'' (Campaign Diary) was published in 1941. Later still, in 1980, Nicaraguan poet Ernesto Mej\u00eda S\u00e1nchez produced a set of about thirty of Mart\u00ed's articles written for the Mexican newspaper ''El Partido Liberal'' that weren't included in any of his so-called ''Obras Completas'' editions. From 1882 to 1891, Mart\u00ed collaborated in ''La Naci\u00f3n'', a Buenos Aires newspaper. His texts from ''La Naci\u00f3n'' have been collected in ''Anuario del centro de Estudios Mart\u00edanos''.\n\nOver the course of his journalistic career, he wrote for numerous newspapers, starting with ''El Diablo Cojuelo'' (The Limping Devil) and ''La Patria Libre'' (The Free Fatherland), both of which he helped to found in 1869 in Cuba and which established the extent of his political commitment and vision for Cuba. In Spain he wrote for ''La Colonia Espa\u00f1ola'',in Mexico for ''La Revista Universal'', and in Venezuela for ''Revista Venezolana'', which he founded. In New York he contributed to Venezuelan periodical ''La Opini\u00f3n Nacional'', Buenos Aires newspaper ''La Naci\u00f3n'', Mexico's ''La Opinion Liberal'', and ''The Hour'' from the U.S.<ref>{{harvnb|Mart\u00ed|1992|p= 8}}{{Clarify|date=November 2008}}<!--Or is it Fern\u00e1ndez Retamar, say his introduction, that's actually being quoted here? In which case, we need the full and accurate reference below--></ref>\n\nThe first critical edition of Mart\u00ed's complete works began to appear in 1983 in ''Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed: Obras completas. Edici\u00f3n cr\u00edtica''. The critical edition of his complete poems was published in 1985 in ''Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed: Poes\u00eda completa. Edici\u00f3n critica.''\n\nVolume two of his ''Obras Completas'' includes his famous essay 'Nuestra America' which \"comprises a variety of subjects relating to Spanish America about which Mart\u00ed studied and wrote. Here it is noted that after Cuba his interest was directed mostly to Guatemala, Mexico and Venezuela. The various sections of this part are about general matters and international conferences; economic, social and political questions; literature and art; agrarian and industrial problems; immigration; education; relations with the United States and Spanish America; travel notes\".<ref>{{harvnb|Roscoe|1947|p= 280}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Mart\u00ed, the intention behind the publication of \"La edad de oro\" was \"so that American children may know how people used to live, and how they live nowadays, in the United States and in other countries; how many things are made, such as glass and iron, steam engines and suspension bridges and electric light; so that when a child sees a coloured stone he will know why the stone is coloured. ... We shall tell them about everything which is done in factories, where things happen which are stranger and more interesting than the magic in fairy stories. These things are real magic, more marvelous than any. ... We write for children because it is they who know how to love, because it is children who are the hope for the world\".<ref>{{harvnb|Nassif|1994|p= 2}}</ref>\n\nMart\u00ed's \"[[Versos Sencillos]]\" was written \"in the town of [[Haines Falls, New York]], where his doctor has sent [him] to regain his strength 'where streams flowed and clouds gathered in upon themeselves'\".<ref name=\"Oberhelman 2001 475\">{{harvnb|Oberhelman|2001|p= 475}}</ref> The poetry encountered in this work is \"in many [ways] autobiographical and allows readers to see Mart\u00ed the man and the patriot and to judge what was important to him at a crucial time in Cuban history\".<ref name=\"Oberhelman 2001 475\"/>\n\nMart\u00ed's writings reflected his own views both socially and politically. \"Cultivo Una Rosa Blanca\" is one of his poems that emphasize his views in hopes of betterment for society:\n\n{{poemquote|I cultivate a white rose\nIn July as in January\nFor the sincere friend\nWho gives me his hand frankly\nAnd for the cruel person who tears\nout the heart with which I live,\nI cultivate neither nettles nor thorns:\nI cultivate a white rose<ref>Mart\u00ed, Jos\u00e9, Manuel A.Tellechea Versos Sencillos. U of Houston: Arte P\u00fablico Press, 1997</ref>}}\n\nThis poem is a clear description of Mart\u00ed's societal hopes for his homeland. Within the poem, he talks about how regardless of the person, whether kind or cruel he cultivates a white rose, meaning that he remains peaceful. This coincides with his ideology about establishing unity amongst the people, more so those of Cuba, through a common identity, with no regards to ethnic and racial differences.<ref>\n\nMorukian, Maria. \"Cubanidad: Survival of Cuban Culture Identity in the 21st Century\".</ref> This doctrine could be accomplished if one treated his enemy with peace as he would treat a friend. The kindness of one person should be shared with all people, regardless of personal conflict. By following the moral that lies within \"Cultivo Rosa Blanca\", Mart\u00ed's vision of Cuban solidarity could be possible, creating a more peaceful society that would emanate through future generations.\n\nAfter his breakthrough in Cuba literature, Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed went on to contribute his works to newspapers, magazines, and books that reflected his political and social views. Because of his early death, Mart\u00ed was unable to publish a vast collection of poetry; even so, his literary contributions have made him a renowned figure in literature, influencing many writers, and people in general, to aspire to follow in the footsteps of Mart\u00ed.\n\n===Style===\nMart\u00ed's style of writing is difficult to categorize. He used many [[aphorism]]s\u2014short, memorable lines that convey truth and/or wisdom\u2014and long complex sentences. He is considered a major contributor to the Spanish American literary movement known as [[Modernismo]] and has been linked to Latin American consciousness of the modern age and modernity.<ref>{{harvnb|Fern\u00e1ndez Retamar|1970|p= 38}}</ref> His chronicles combined elements of literary portraiture, dramatic narration, and a dioramic scope. His poetry contained \"fresh and astonishing images along with deceptively simple sentiments\".<ref>{{harvnb|Fountain|2003|p= 6}}</ref> As an orator (for he made many speeches) he was known for his cascading structure, powerful aphorisms, and detailed descriptions. More important than his style is how he uses that style to put into service his ideas, making \"advanced\" convincing notions. Throughout his writing he made reference to historical figures and events, and used constant allusions to literature, current news and cultural matters. For this reason, he may be difficult to read and translate.<ref>{{harvnb|Hern\u00e1ndez Pardo|2000|p= 146}}</ref>\n\nHis didactic spirit encouraged him to establish a magazine for children, ''La Edad de Oro'' (1889) which contained a short essay titled \"Tres Heroes\" (three heroes), representative of his talent to adapt his expression to his audience; in this case, to make the young reader conscious of and amazed by the extraordinary bravery of the three men, Bolivar, Hidalgo, and San Mart\u00edn. This is his style to teach delightfully.<ref>Garganigo, p. 273{{Clarify|date=November 2008}}<!--who's the author, what's the title of the piece in this anthology?--></ref>\n\n===Translation===\nJos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed is universally honored as a great poet, patriot and martyr of [[Cuban War of Independence|Cuban Independence]], but he was also a [[translator]] of some note. Although he translated literary material for the sheer joy of it, much of the translating he did was imposed on him by economic necessity during his many years of exile in the United States. Mart\u00ed learned English at an early age, and had begun to translate at thirteen. He continued translating for the rest of his life, including his time as a student in Spain, although the period of his greatest productivity was during his stay in New York from 1880 until he returned to Cuba in 1895.<ref>{{harvnb|Fountain|2003|p= 13}}</ref>\n[[File:Jose Marti Statue.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Jose Mart\u00ed in a government school named after him in Delhi]]\n\nIn New York he was what is known today as a \"[[freelance]]r,\" as well as an \"[[in house]]\" translator. He translated several books for the publishing house of [[D. Appleton & Company|D. Appleton]], and did a series of translations for newspapers. As a revolutionary activist in Cuba's long struggle for independence he translated into English a number of articles and pamphlets supporting that movement.<ref>{{harvnb|Fountain|2003|p= 15}}</ref> In addition to fluent English, Mart\u00ed also spoke French, Italian, Latin and Classical Greek fluently, the latter learned so he could read the Greek classical works in the original.<ref>{{harvnb|Fern\u00e1ndez Retamar|1970|p= 16}}</ref>\n\nThere was clearly a dichotomy in Mart\u00ed's feeling about the kind of work he was translating. Like many professionals, he undertook for money translation tasks which had little intellectual or emotional appeal for him. Although Mart\u00ed never presented a systematic theory of translation nor did he write extensively about his approach to translation, he did jot down occasional thoughts on the subject, showcasing his awareness of the translator's dilemma of the faithful versus the beautiful and stating that \"translation should be natural, so that it appears that the book were written in the language to which it has been translated\".<ref>\"la traducci\u00f3n debe ser natural, para que parezca como si el libro hubiese sido escrito en la lengua al que lo traduces.\" {{harvnb|De la Cuesta|1996|p=7 }}</ref>\n\n===Modernism===\nThe modernists, in general, use a subjective language. Mart\u00ed's stylistic creed is part of the necessity to de-codify the logic rigor and the linguistic construction and to eliminate the intellectual, abstract and systematic expression. There is the deliberate intention and awareness to expand the expressive system of the language. The style changes the form of thinking. Without falling into unilateralism, Mart\u00ed values the expression because language is an impression and a feeling through the form. Modernism mostly searches for the visions and realities, the expression takes in the impressions, the state of mind, without reflection and without concept. This is the law of subjectivity. We can see this in works of Mart\u00ed, one of the first modernists, who conceives the literary task like an invisible unity, an expressive totality, considering the style like \"a form of the content\" (forma del contenido).<ref>{{harvnb|Serna|2002|p= 13}}</ref>\n\nThe difference that Mart\u00ed established between prose and poetry are conceptual. Poetry, as he believes, is a language of the permanent subjective: the intuition and the vision. The prose is an instrument and a method of spreading the ideas, and has the goal of elevating, encouraging and animating these ideas rather than having the expression of tearing up the heart, complaining and moaning. The prose is a service to his people.<ref name=\"serna14\">{{harvnb|Serna|2002|p= 14}}</ref>\n\nMart\u00ed produces a system of specific signs \"an ideological code\" (c\u00f3digo ideol\u00f3gico). These symbols claim their moral value and construct signs of ethic conduct. Mart\u00ed's modernism was a spiritual attitude that was reflected on the language. All his writing defines his moral world. One could also say that his ideological and spiritual sphere is fortified in his writing.<ref name=\"serna14\" />\n\nThe difference between Mart\u00ed and other modernist initiators such as Manuel Guti\u00e9rrez N\u00e1jera, Juli\u00e1n del Casal, and Jos\u00e9 Asunci\u00f3n Silva (and the similarity between him and Manuel Gonz\u00e1lez Prada) lies in the profound and transcendent value that he gave to literature, converting prose into an article or the work of a journalist. This hard work was important in giving literature authentic and independent value and distancing it from mere formal amusement. Manuel Guti\u00e9rez N\u00e1jera, Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo, Miguel de Unamuno and Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3 saved the Mart\u00ednian articles, which will have an endless value in the writings of the American continent.<ref name=\"serna16\">{{harvnb|Serna|2002|p= 16}}</ref>\n\nApart from Mart\u00ednian articles. essay writing and literature starts to authorize itself as an alternative and privileged way to talk about politics. Literature starts to apply itself the only hermeneutics able to resolve the enigmas of a Latin American identity.<ref name=\"serna16\" />\n\n==Legacy==\n===Symbol of Cuban independence===\n[[File:Marti Cienfuegos.jpg|thumb|300px|Statue of Mart\u00ed in [[Cienfuegos, Cuba]]]]\nMart\u00ed's dedication to the cause of Cuban independence and his passionate belief in democracy and justice has made him a hero for all Cubans, a symbol of unity, the \"Apostle\",<ref>Lopez 2006, p. 11</ref> a great leader.
